## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

When loading a specific configuration, users has to append a version dependent suffix:

#### MARC-ja

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("shunk031/JGLUE", name="MARC-ja")

print(dataset)
# DatasetDict({
#     train: Dataset({
#         features: ['sentence', 'label', 'review_id'],
#         num_rows: 187528
#     })
#     validation: Dataset({
#         features: ['sentence', 'label', 'review_id'],
#         num_rows: 5654
#     })
# })
```

#### JCoLA

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("shunk031/JGLUE", name="JCoLA")

print(dataset)
# DatasetDict({
#     train: Dataset({
#         features: ['uid', 'source', 'label', 'diacritic', 'sentence', 'original', 'translation', 'gloss', 'simple', 'linguistic_phenomenon'],
#         num_rows: 6919
#     })
#     validation: Dataset({
#         features: ['uid', 'source', 'label', 'diacritic', 'sentence', 'original', 'translation', 'gloss', 'simple', 'linguistic_phenomenon'],
#         num_rows: 865

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

From [JGLUE's paper](https://aclanthology.org/2022.lrec-1.317/):

> JGLUE is designed to cover a wide range of GLUE and SuperGLUE tasks and consists of three kinds of tasks: text classification, sentence pair classification, and question answering.

### Source Data

#### Initial Data Collection and Normalization

[More Information Needed]

#### Who are the source language producers?

- The source language producers are users of Amazon (MARC-ja), crowd-workers of [Yahoo! Crowdsourcing](https://crowdsourcing.yahoo.co.jp/) (JSTS, JNLI and JCommonsenseQA), writers of the Japanese Wikipedia (JSQuAD), crowd-workers of [Lancers](https://www.lancers.jp/).

### Annotations

#### Annotation process

##### MARC-ja

From [JGLUE's paper](https://aclanthology.org/2022.lrec-1.317/):

> As one of the text classification datasets, we build a dataset based on the Multilingual Amazon Reviews Corpus (MARC) (Keung et al., 2020). MARC is a multilingual corpus of product reviews with 5-level star ratings (1-5) on the Amazon shopping site. This corpus covers six languages, including English and Japanese. For JGLUE, we use the Japanese part of MARC and to make it easy for both humans and computers to judge a class label, we cast the text classification task as a binary classification task, where 1- and 2-star ratings are converted to “negative”, and 4 and 5 are converted to “positive”. We do not use reviews with a 3-star rating. 

> One of the problems with MARC is that it sometimes contains data where the rating diverges from the review text. This happens, for example, when a review with positive content is given a rating of 1 or 2. These data degrade the quality of our dataset. To improve the quality of the dev/test instances used for evaluation, we crowdsource a positive/negative judgment task for approximately 12,000 reviews. We adopt only reviews with the same votes from 7 or more out of 10 workers and assign a label of the maximum votes to these reviews. We divide the resulting reviews into dev/test data. 

> We obtained 5,654 and 5,639 instances for the dev and test data, respectively, through the above procedure. For the training data, we extracted 187,528 instances directly from MARC without performing the cleaning procedure because of the large number of training instances. The statistics of MARC-ja are listed in Table 2. For the evaluation metric for MARC-ja, we use accuracy because it is a binary classification task of texts.

##### JCoLA

From [JCoLA's paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12676):

> ### 3 JCoLA
> In this study, we introduce JCoLA (Japanese Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability), which will be the first large-scale acceptability judgment task dataset focusing on Japanese. JCoLA consists of sentences from textbooks and handbooks on Japanese syntax, as well as from journal articles on Japanese syntax that are published in JEAL (Journal of East Asian Linguistics), one of the prestigious journals in theoretical linguistics.

> #### 3.1 Data Collection
> Sentences in JCoLA were collected from prominent textbooks and handbooks focusing on Japanese syntax. In addition to the main text, example sentences included in the footnotes were also considered for collection. We also collected acceptability judgments from journal articles on Japanese syntax published in JEAL (Journal of East Asian Linguistics): one of the prestigious journals in the-oretical linguistics. Specifically, we examined all the articles published in JEAL between 2006 and 2015 (133 papers in total), and extracted 2,252 acceptability judgments from 26 papers on Japanese syntax (Table 2). Acceptability judgments include sentences in appendices and footnotes, but not sentences presented for analyses of syntactic structures (e.g. sentences with brackets to show their syntactic structures). As a result, a total of 11,984 example. sentences were collected. Using this as a basis, JCoLA was constructed through the methodology explained in the following sections.

##### JSTS and JNLI

From [JGLUE's paper](https://aclanthology.org/2022.lrec-1.317/):

> For the sentence pair classification datasets, we construct a semantic textual similarity (STS) dataset, JSTS, and a natural language inference (NLI) dataset, JNLI.

> ### Overview
> STS is a task of estimating the semantic similarity of a sentence pair. Gold similarity is usually assigned as an average of the integer values 0 (completely different meaning) to 5 (equivalent meaning) assigned by multiple workers through crowdsourcing.

> NLI is a task of recognizing the inference relation that a premise sentence has to a hypothesis sentence. Inference relations are generally defined by three labels: “entailment”, “contradiction”, and “neutral”. Gold inference relations are often assigned by majority voting after collecting answers from multiple workers through crowdsourcing.

> For the STS and NLI tasks, STS-B (Cer et al., 2017) and MultiNLI (Williams et al., 2018) are included in GLUE, respectively. As Japanese datasets, JSNLI (Yoshikoshi et al., 2020) is a machine translated dataset of the NLI dataset SNLI (Stanford NLI), and JSICK (Yanaka and Mineshima, 2021) is a human translated dataset of the STS/NLI dataset SICK (Marelli et al., 2014). As mentioned in Section 1, these have problems originating from automatic/manual translations. To solve this problem, we construct STS/NLI datasets in Japanese from scratch. We basically extract sentence pairs in JSTS and JNLI from the Japanese version of the MS COCO Caption Dataset (Chen et al., 2015), the YJ Captions Dataset (Miyazaki and Shimizu, 2016). Most of the sentence pairs in JSTS and JNLI overlap, allowing us to analyze the relationship between similarities and inference relations for the same sentence pairs like SICK and JSICK.

> The similarity value in JSTS is assigned a real number from 0 to 5 as in STS-B. The inference relation in JNLI is assigned from the above three labels as in SNLI and MultiNLI. The definitions of the inference relations are also based on SNLI.

> ### Method of Construction
> Our construction flow for JSTS and JNLI is shown in Figure 1. Basically, two captions for the same image of YJ Captions are used as sentence pairs. For these sentence pairs, similarities and NLI relations of entailment and neutral are obtained by crowdsourcing. However, it is difficult to collect sentence pairs with low similarity and contradiction relations from captions for the same image. To solve this problem, we collect sentence pairs with low similarity from captions for different images. We collect contradiction relations by asking workers to write contradictory sentences for a given caption. 

> The detailed construction procedure for JSTS and JNLI is described below.
> 1. We crowdsource an STS task using two captions for the same image from YJ Captions. We ask five workers to answer the similarity between two captions and take the mean value as the gold similarity. We delete sentence pairs with a large variance in the answers because such pairs have poor answer quality. We performed this task on 16,000 sentence pairs and deleted sentence pairs with a similarity variance of 1.0 or higher, resulting in the collection of 10,236 sentence pairs with gold similarity. We refer to this collected data as JSTS-A.
> 2. To collect sentence pairs with low similarity, we crowdsource the same STS task as Step 1 using sentence pairs of captions for different images. We conducted this task on 4,000 sentence pairs and collected 2,970 sentence pairs with gold similarity. We refer to this collected data as JSTS-B.
> 3. For JSTS-A, we crowdsource an NLI task. Since inference relations are directional, we obtain inference relations in both directions for sentence pairs. As mentioned earlier,it is difficult to collect instances of contradiction from JSTS-A, which was collected from the captions of the same images,and thus we collect instances of entailment and neutral in this step. We collect inference relation answers from 10 workers. If six or more people give the same answer, we adopt it as the gold label if it is entailment or neutral. To obtain inference relations in both directions for JSTS-A, we performed this task on 20,472 sentence pairs, twice as many as JSTS-A. As a result, we collected inference relations for 17,501 sentence pairs. We refer to this collected data as JNLI-A. We do not use JSTS-B for the NLI task because it is difficult to define and determine the inference relations between captions of different images.
> 4. To collect NLI instances of contradiction, we crowdsource a task of writing four contradictory sentences for each caption in YJCaptions. From the written sentences, we remove sentence pairs with an edit distance of 0.75 or higher to remove low-quality sentences, such as short sentences and sentences with low relevance to the original sentence. Furthermore, we perform a one-way NLI task with 10 workers to verify whether the created sentence pairs are contradictory. Only the sentence pairs answered as contradiction by at least six workers are adopted. Finally,since the contradiction relation has no direction, we automatically assign contradiction in the opposite direction of the adopted sentence pairs. Using 1,800 captions, we acquired 7,200 sentence pairs, from which we collected 3,779 sentence pairs to which we assigned the one-way contradiction relation.By automatically assigning the contradiction relation in the opposite direction, we doubled the number of instances to 7,558. We refer to this collected data as JNLI-C.
> 5. For the 3,779 sentence pairs collected in Step 4, we crowdsource an STS task, assigning similarity  and filtering in the same way as in Steps1 and 2. In this way, we collected 2,303 sentence pairs with gold similarity from 3,779 pairs. We refer to this collected data as JSTS-C.

##### JSQuAD

From [JGLUE's paper](https://aclanthology.org/2022.lrec-1.317/):

> As QA datasets, we build a Japanese version of SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), one of the datasets of reading comprehension, and a Japanese version ofCommonsenseQA, which is explained in the next section.

> Reading comprehension is the task of reading a document and answering questions about it. Many reading comprehension evaluation sets have been built in English, followed by those in other languages or multilingual ones.

> In Japanese, reading comprehension datasets for quizzes (Suzukietal.,2018) and those in the drivingdomain (Takahashi et al., 2019) have been built, but none are in the general domain. We use Wikipedia to build a dataset for the general domain. The construction process is basically based on SQuAD 1.1 (Rajpurkar et al., 2016). 

> First, to extract high-quality articles from Wikipedia, we use Nayuki, which estimates the quality of articles on the basis of hyperlinks in Wikipedia. We randomly chose 822 articles from the top-ranked 10,000 articles. For example, the articles include “熊本県 (Kumamoto Prefecture)” and “フランス料理 (French cuisine)”. Next, we divide an article into paragraphs, present each paragraph to crowdworkers, and ask them to write questions and answers that can be answered if one understands the paragraph. Figure 2 shows an example of JSQuAD. We ask workers to write two additional answers for the dev and test sets to make the system evaluation robust.

##### JCommonsenseQA

From [JGLUE's paper](https://aclanthology.org/2022.lrec-1.317/):

> ### Overview
> JCommonsenseQA is a Japanese version of CommonsenseQA (Talmor et al., 2019), which consists of five choice QA to evaluate commonsense reasoning ability. Figure 3 shows examples of JCommonsenseQA. In the same way as CommonsenseQA, JCommonsenseQA is built using crowdsourcing with seeds extracted from the knowledge base ConceptNet (Speer et al., 2017). ConceptNet is a multilingual knowledge base that consists of triplets of two concepts and their relation. The triplets are directional and represented as (source concept, relation, target concept), for example (bullet train, AtLocation, station).

> ### Method of Construction
> The construction flow for JCommonsenseQA is shown in Figure 4. First, we collect question sets (QSs) from ConceptNet, each of which consists of a source concept and three target concepts that have the same relation to the source concept. Next, for each QS, we crowdAtLocation 2961source a task of writing a question with only one target concept as the answer and a task of adding two distractors. We describe the detailed construction procedure for JCommonsenseQA below, showing how it differs from CommonsenseQA.

> 1. We collect Japanese QSs from ConceptNet. CommonsenseQA uses only forward relations (source concept, relation, target concept) excluding general ones such as “RelatedTo” and “IsA”. JCommonsenseQA similarly uses a set of 22 relations5, excluding general ones, but the direction of the relations is bidirectional to make the questions more diverse. In other words, we also use relations in the opposite direction (source concept, relation−1, target concept).6 With this setup, we extracted 43,566 QSs with Japanese source/target concepts and randomly selected 7,500 from them.
> 2. Some low-quality questions in CommonsenseQA contain distractors that can be considered to be an answer. To improve the quality of distractors, we add the following two processes that are not adopted in CommonsenseQA. First, if three target concepts of a QS include a spelling variation or a synonym of one another, this QS is removed. To identify spelling variations, we use the word ID of the morphological dictionary Juman Dic7. Second, we crowdsource a task of judging whether target concepts contain a synonym. As a result, we adopted 5,920 QSs from 7,500.
> 3. For each QS, we crowdsource a task of writing a question sentence in which only one from the three target concepts is an answer. In the example shown in Figure 4, “駅 (station)” is an answer, and the others are distractors. To remove low quality question sentences, we remove the following question sentences.
>    - Question sentences that contain a choice word(this is because such a question is easily solved).
>    - Question sentences that contain the expression “XX characters”.8 (XX is a number).
>    - Improperly formatted question sentences that do not end with “?”.
>    - As a result, 5,920 × 3 = 17,760question sentences were created, from which we adopted 15,310 by removing inappropriate question sentences.
> 4. In CommonsenseQA, when adding distractors, one is selected from ConceptNet, and the other is created by crowdsourcing. In JCommonsenseQA, to have a wider variety of distractors, two distractors are created by crowdsourcing instead of selecting from ConceptNet. To improve the quality of the questions9, we remove questions whose added distractors fall into one of the following categories:
>    - Distractors are included in a question sentence.
>    - Distractors overlap with one of existing choices.
>    - As a result, distractors were added to the 15,310 questions, of which we adopted 13,906.
> 5. We asked three crowdworkers to answer each question and adopt only those answered correctly by at least two workers. As a result, we adopted 11,263 out of the 13,906 questions.

#### Who are the annotators?

From [JGLUE's README.md](https://github.com/yahoojapan/JGLUE/blob/main/README.md#tasksdatasets):

> We use Yahoo! Crowdsourcing for all crowdsourcing tasks in constructing the datasets.

From [JCoLA's paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12676):

> As a reference for the upper limit of accuracy in JCoLA, human acceptability judgment experiments were conducted on Lancers2 with a subset of the JCoLA data.

### Discussion of Biases

### Other Known Limitations

From [JCoLA's paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12676):

> All the sentences included in JCoLA have been extracted from textbooks, handbooks and journal articles on theoretical syntax. Therefore, those sentences are guaranteed to be theoretically meaningful, making JCoLA a challenging dataset. However, the distribution of linguistic phenomena directly reflects that of the source literature and thus turns out to be extremely skewed. Indeed, as can be seen in Table 3, while the number of sentences exceeds 100 for most linguistic phenomena, there are several linguistic phenomena for which there are only about 10 sentences. In addition, since it is difficult to force language models to interpret sentences given specific contexts, those sentences whose unacceptability depends on contexts were inevitably removed from JCoLA. This removal process resulted in the deletion of unacceptable sentences from some linguistic phenomena (such as ellipsis), consequently skewing the balance between acceptable and unacceptable sentences (with a higher proportion of acceptable sentences).
